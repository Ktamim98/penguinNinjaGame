## Overview
In the Penguin Ninja Game, players can enjoy a touch-based interaction by using swiping gestures to slice penguins that appear on the screen. The objective is to slice as many penguins as possible while avoiding bombs. Slicing a penguin adds points to the score, while hitting a bomb results in the player losing a life. The game ends when all lives are depleted.
The project utilizes the SpriteKit framework, which is a powerful and intuitive framework for building 2D games in iOS. It leverages physics simulation, animation, and touch handling capabilities to create a fun and immersive gameplay experience.

## Project Structure
- GameScene.swift: This is the main scene class responsible for handling the game logic, including penguin and bomb spawning, slicing, scoring, and managing game over conditions.
- Assets.xcassets: Contains the image assets used in the game, including penguins, bombs, and life indicators.
- Particle.sks: Defines the particle effects used for visual feedback when slicing penguins and hitting bombs.
- Sounds: Contains the sound effects used in the game, such as slicing sounds, explosion sounds, and background music.
## Tools and Technologies
- Xcode: The project is developed using Xcode, an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS that provides all the necessary tools for iOS app development.
- Swift: The programming language used for developing iOS apps.
- SpriteKit: A framework provided by Apple for building 2D games and animations in iOS.
- AVFoundation: A framework used for playing sound effects and background music in the game.
- UIKit: A framework used for handling touch events and user interface elements.
